2017-04-11 21:12:47	styks1987	It feels wrong but I’d rather not over complicate this if possible
2017-04-11 21:13:12	GreenJello	styks1987, I'd use redux for this
2017-04-11 21:13:16	samsch	styks1987, Ok, so really your only options are: pass the object down from your root component (not usually reasonable), import a "singleton" module (not a great pattern, but probably better than window.something), or use context.
2017-04-11 21:13:18	tomasm-	is there an easy way to get a better stack trace when I get a rare error with react native about RawText "0" needing wrapping in <Text>? I really just don't know where it is in my app, but there's a point where it gets hit and the normal exception stack doesn't tell me the context, ie what component/class it's currently evaluating
2017-04-11 21:13:24	GreenJello	styks1987, that also ensures you get the new version when they change settings
2017-04-11 21:14:06	samsch	styks1987, Context is what Redux (and several other tools which need to get data throughout the tree) use.
2017-04-11 21:14:17	GreenJello	tomasm-, you could do some hack like overriding React.createElement
2017-04-11 21:14:29	styks1987	ok thanks for the tips
2017-04-11 21:14:31	GreenJello	and inspect children prop
2017-04-11 21:15:04	dminuoso	samsch: redux uses context?
2017-04-11 21:15:11	GreenJello	tomasm-, but if you have the time, file an issue; that's something they could improve

2017-04-11 21:15:30	samsch	It's "technically" unstable, but mostly because it has some odd issues and if they can find something better it would be replaced. However, it is "stable" for React 15 (and probably 16 as well), and most likely won't go away unless replaced by something better which can do the same jobs.
2017-04-11 21:15:34	dminuoso	That's really interesting, I always assumed connect() magically wired event listeners left and right.

2017-04-11 21:15:45	GreenJello	the problem with context is that most people would do it wrong
2017-04-11 21:16:01	GreenJello	you need to pass a static value, like an event emitter, through context
2017-04-11 21:16:06	samsch	dminuoso, It uses context to get subscribers and dispatch to components.
2017-04-11 21:16:15	GreenJello	since you can never ensure context will update
2017-04-11 21:17:17	Glenjamin	context is a bad for values

2017-04-11 21:19:53	styks1987	GreenJello: when you say static are you refering to just properties on a class (functions and/or values) that can be accessed without instantiating the class?
2017-04-11 21:20:12	dminuoso	samsch: Oh, is this what the Provider is all about?
2017-04-11 21:20:13	Glenjamin	i think he means things that don't change
2017-04-11 21:20:20	GreenJello	styks1987, I mean values that never change
2017-04-11 21:20:34	GreenJello	styks1987, e.g. instead of passing the store state through context, redux passes a getState function
2017-04-11 21:20:37	Glenjamin	dminuoso: yeah, provider adds the store to context, connect() access the store
2017-04-11 21:20:38	samsch	dminuoso, Yep, if you take a look at the Provider source, it's a pretty simple context injector.
2017-04-11 21:20:45	GreenJello	that function never changes, but returns different state when called
2017-04-11 21:21:00	styks1987	GreenJello: I see
2017-04-11 21:22:36	dminuoso	Glenjamin, samsch: This is amazing. redux is becoming far less magical every day, it seems quite simplistic really.
2017-04-11 21:23:01	Glenjamin	react-redux's connect() is a minefield

2017-04-11 22:21:27	th3fallen	dminuoso so what's not happening with this config? it's reloading everything but loses state for the components?
2017-04-11 22:22:08	dminuoso	th3fallen: Right, because Routes wont update unless I force this key prop into them.
2017-04-11 22:22:16	dminuoso	If I foce this key prop into them, I lose state.
2017-04-11 22:22:42	dminuoso	(This is because Im using async routes)

2017-04-11 22:27:32	dminuoso	Since I generate all my routes using plop anyway, it's just a matter of a tiny change to the generator.

2017-04-12 07:30:54	BigJono	Actually while I'm on the subject of webpack, I have one more question. Why is all our code in our bundles executed using eval?
2017-04-12 07:30:57	BigJono	Is that a sourcemaps thing?
2017-04-12 07:31:37	Sami	I have a little issue that I want to solve : I'm creating a list of components buy filling in props from an API. I developped a filter sidebar to send some parameters, to get a new JSON list. How to delete the old components list and render the new one ?

2017-04-12 07:32:49	BigJono	Sami: You don't ever really "delete old stuff and render new stuff" in React. You design your components so they render based on what is in the state, then you change the state
2017-04-12 07:33:33	Sami	Ok
2017-04-12 07:33:34	BigJono	So in this case you'd put the stuff from the API call in state, then replace it when you get new stuff
2017-04-12 07:34:18	Sami	the state contain the JSON list of posts
2017-04-12 07:35:01	Sami	I'm mapping this list to create Posts

2017-04-12 12:45:35	DannyWolff	Hi Could you help me please. I try to follow a tutorial on submiting forms but in the new version of react 'this.refs.inputName' does not work anymore. I tried to set a state. It works fine with one input but with three it's writing the same thing in all three boxes.I dont need the code but some ideas if is possiible . Thanks
2017-04-12 12:47:35	dminuoso	DannyWolff: a) Gist your component, b) it's probably best to avoid refs callbacks altogether.
2017-04-12 12:48:18	DannyWolff	thanks
2017-04-12 12:48:25	dminuoso	DannyWolff: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html  -> This is not only up-to-date, it's also official and the officially endorsed way to maintain forms.

2017-04-12 13:51:01	ycon_	Hi all, I need advice with this code. Basically I'm using sockets to have chat & rooms. BUt I cant understand a good way to pass my "room" variable value to my socket. Would apprecaite advice http://dpaste.com/1B6K9P4
2017-04-12 13:53:13	ycon_	My steps are- 1. Get a list of chat rooms 2. Pass those chat "rooms" into my socket, so it can listen at all those rooms
