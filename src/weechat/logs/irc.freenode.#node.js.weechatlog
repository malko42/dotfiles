2017-04-11 19:12:08	b00gpie	Hi, I'm looking for a release procedure on node projects that doesn't involve commiting to git in order to create a version. Something along the line of Nebula release plugin on Java, one that knows how to understand what's the next version based on previous tags / commits. I am familiar with semantic-release-cli, it seems to create a new commit for a new version which is not what I want. Anyone using a
2017-04-11 19:12:14	b00gpie	similar procedure? any recommendations?

2017-04-11 19:31:43	b00gpie	well, here's the things
2017-04-11 19:31:55	b00gpie	there isn't just one branch all the way to production
2017-04-11 19:31:56	DeltaHeavy	prometh Yeah but going right from feature -> master can cause mad problems IME
2017-04-11 19:32:09	b00gpie	see, there are different components - Javascript libraries & apps, backend, etc.
2017-04-11 19:32:12	prometh	DeltaHeavy: even with tests passing and peer review? it sounds reasonable to me
2017-04-11 19:32:22	prometh	b00gpie: backend should be separate
2017-04-11 19:32:22	DeltaHeavy	Even with all that stuff yes
2017-04-11 19:32:23	b00gpie	Each component has a pipeline all the way to some 'verified builds' repo
2017-04-11 19:32:27	DeltaHeavy	Tests nor people are bulletproof.
2017-04-11 19:32:32	b00gpie	all repos are separate

2017-04-11 19:33:06	prometh	b00gpie: so deplying UI would deploy existing and test-passing backend
2017-04-11 19:33:08	DeltaHeavy	prometh That you're not polluting the stable release with things that have simply been reviewed and passed unit tests. 2 feature branches could mess eachother up and break things
2017-04-11 19:33:15	b00gpie	Each build is tested, and if successful its number is maintained together with the tested versions of all other components
2017-04-11 19:33:44	prometh	DeltaHeavy: only one feature branch can merge at a time.. if there's a problem, you'll have merge conflicts before merging the second

2017-04-11 19:34:52	DeltaHeavy	prometh You should test EVERYTHING for a release BEFORE it's in master. When that GROUP of things is tested, THEN you move it into master
2017-04-11 19:35:29	prometh	just merge them in immediate succession
2017-04-11 19:35:33	b00gpie	DeltaHeavy: ok, still there's a matrix of possible tested versions

2017-04-11 22:56:42	alextes	"[22:03:48]  <`slikts>	a plugin's peer dependencies do not belong in the parent package's dependencies" I really think they do. If you use grunt-contrib-jshint for your project, you should have grunt in your dependencies not the grunt-contrib-jshint package.
2017-04-11 22:56:56	dman777	dyyylan: when you run the cron job once a week.... what if a user has uploaded a image at that moment but isn't done with the form yet?
2017-04-11 22:57:01	joepie91	unfortunately I get distracted easily so when I turn on my distraction monitor to contact somebody about something... I end up here :P
2017-04-11 22:57:14	dyyylan	dman777: when you upload the image you store the created date in the table that references it
2017-04-11 22:57:29	`slikts	alextes: grunt would be a direct dependency
2017-04-11 22:57:37	dman777	dyyylan: ah...smart. do you use multer for the images?
2017-04-11 22:57:42	ljharb	`slikts: yes but grunt is a peer dep of a grunt plugin
2017-04-11 22:57:47	dyyylan	what is multer
2017-04-11 22:57:54	ljharb	that's just the nature of plugins; peer deps are the way to represent their relationships.
2017-04-11 22:58:05	`slikts	ljharb: the menagerie of peer deps eslint-config-airbnb has are not direct dependencies, though

2017-04-11 23:02:29	alextes	when I imagine a user friendly way I pretty much end up with whats already there. the only missing link is if a peer dep is missing at the end of an install, suggest / help out with doing another install.

2017-04-12 00:47:59	asteele	wkhtmltopdf was actually kind of working, it works on things like google, but when i try to apply it to my local project it just blows up, takes like 30 seconds before it loads my app, its really weird.  i have a few hunches still to check over, related to things like the user of border-radius and dumb things
2017-04-12 00:48:06	odigity	asteele, I'm just trying to find a reference for the error object return by mysql and mysql2.  there's no code to show, I don't have a bug, I'm missing information.  I want to know how to get useful info out of that object.
2017-04-12 00:48:23	prometh	not many tools use webkit anymore.. phantomjs is a fork of it
2017-04-12 00:48:32	prometh	electron is fast.. i'd try to use it
2017-04-12 00:48:50	asteele	im going to give one of these ones based on phantom a shot

2017-04-12 01:44:24	prometh	and if you need desktop or mobile, you can wrap it with cordova or electron
2017-04-12 01:44:38	prometh	cuts down cost significantly
2017-04-12 01:44:57	nahtnam	hahah I just realized im running chrome, vs code, hyper (terminal), boxy, spotify, messenger for desktop and slack
2017-04-12 01:45:07	nahtnam	pretty much every single app i have open in made with js

2017-04-12 01:45:45	nahtnam	Anyways I come bearing a question
2017-04-12 01:45:55	nahtnam	How can I programmatically do something like nodemon
2017-04-12 01:46:14	GreenJello	nahtnam, chokidar
2017-04-12 01:46:30	prometh	chokidar won't restart the process, though
2017-04-12 01:46:34	nahtnam	that was quick
2017-04-12 01:46:45	nahtnam	So basically what im trying to do is make `create-express-app`
2017-04-12 01:46:59	nahtnam	it will basically have a sane index.js for express that you can eject out if you want
2017-04-12 01:47:10	nahtnam	im trying to figure out how to make it so that the express server restarts
2017-04-12 01:47:39	prometh	you could use chokidar and restart express, instead of the whole process

2017-04-12 03:53:09	dman777_alter	such complicated logic when images are outside of the form... but I have to anyways since Polymer's forms are still primitive and won't do multi-data

2017-04-12 08:12:17	modernpacifist	I mean thats 1vCPU and 1GB of RAM - if your compiling node in that thing, its probably going to suck

2017-04-12 08:12:47	lampd1	If u don't wanna compile node run docker
2017-04-12 08:12:53	modernpacifist	Or just use nvm
2017-04-12 08:12:59	lampd1	Or that
2017-04-12 08:13:24	modernpacifist	Not entirely sure why your compiling node...unless your on some arcane distro pre-compiled versions are availble for download or via nvm
2017-04-12 08:15:00	asteele	yeah aws... is like.... really becoming quite ridiculous with some things (Not trying to state the obvious), but how aggressively they rate limit the cpu credits on lower tier ec2 instances now is just nuts
2017-04-12 08:15:54	modernpacifist	asteele: But they're basically 'the cloud' so they can do what they want

2017-04-12 08:16:47	modernpacifist	Or just downloading the newer version from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2017-04-12 08:16:57	asteele	modernpacifist yeah thats the annoying part, theiur whole software suite really is such a hard package to compete with, that you end up just dealing with that kinda stuff, but glad to see the GCE is on the rise and wont let them just shit on everyone
2017-04-12 08:17:48	modernpacifist	asteele: I would actually find it hilarious if they just up and doubled/tripled prices overnight - how many company would be in trouble
2017-04-12 08:17:48	asteele	pgm pretty much any way besides building from source is better, unless you really have a reason to

2017-04-12 08:18:38	modernpacifist	Even with GCE on the rise (and having played with it, I heavily prefer their offerings) I can't even fathom the number of companies that have integrated AWS deep into their workflows

2017-04-12 10:18:45	cads	I asked this question in the php channel and didn't get a very convincing answer... suppose I have a service the allows users to upload files via POSTing to a certain endpoint on the site, and I'd like to make sure the user has filled out a captcha. One way to do this is to send the captcha response to the server, authenticate that, and write a session variable for the user. When the user sends the POST data including the file the server will receive
2017-04-12 10:18:45	cads	the data, then check the session variable for a permission bit set earlier, and flush the data if that bit is not present.

2017-04-12 10:23:56	cads	the issue is that invalid requests will still incur a file upload before being resolved, which can be frustrating for users and an opportunity for attackers
2017-04-12 10:24:45	russellw	The first problem can be solved by having two separate forms
2017-04-12 10:24:45	cads	for example, if the upload takes longer than two minutes, the captcha expires - when the POST data arrives captcha validator rejects the post

2017-04-12 10:28:14	asteele	yeah thats going to be difficult to do as far as im aware, specially when you are using something like php which forces a webserver layer in front
2017-04-12 10:28:31	asteele	the only person that can really cut it off while its in action is the web server
2017-04-12 10:28:36	cads	I'd rather the server be able to make that determination within the first hundred or so bytes and then shut off the connection
2017-04-12 10:29:02	russellw	cads, but 1) does anyone want to DOS your site and 2) if so, will they have significant difficulty even if you do implement what you are looking for? For it to matter, the answer to /both/ those questions has to be yes
2017-04-12 10:29:03	RxMcDonald	Oh i know what the problem could be, it's downloading 60 mb from github lmao
2017-04-12 10:29:25	asteele	RxMcDonald side note, take a look at yarn
2017-04-12 10:29:59	cads	asteele, I don't mind using something other than apache/php for this service, especially if makes these kinds of security decisions easy to implement by default

2017-04-12 11:04:15	asteele	cads yeah, its one of 'those things' i would say, seems like something that would make a lot of sense, but there is no real great solution out there, and most of the world has moved to architect around the problem in other ways (Which in some cases is for good reason)
2017-04-12 11:04:29	cads	AngryChair, I do know that when I'm around other professionals a lot of things I considered difficult suddenly become a lot easier

2017-04-12 11:44:01	nitpe	gajus: great another thing that bothers me a lot in any cinema these days is commercials before the movie
2017-04-12 11:44:02	Sbls	I've seen that most of the library itself is written in JS. That library should be directly portable assuming I have the base ported. Question is: What do I need for the base?

2017-04-12 11:44:48	ningu	I don't know how tightly coupled node's implementation is to v8, but I'd assume fairly tightly
2017-04-12 11:44:53	gajus	I've already invested 90k+ into the project and there is no end to it.
2017-04-12 11:44:53	nitpe	gajus: I would like to have a way to know when the movie is really going to start
2017-04-12 11:45:00	gajus	Therefore, the suggestion makes sense.
2017-04-12 11:45:10	asteele	Sbls Node is a combination of a JS Runtime (ability to understand/run JS Code) and a set of libraries for working with common server-side situations
2017-04-12 11:45:13	Sbls	ningu: That is the heart of NodeJS I assume. However it might be possible to directly use libuv for that.
2017-04-12 11:45:14	nitpe	gajus: even trailers is bullshit, I can watch them on internet anytime
2017-04-12 11:45:26	gajus	Once we raise (if) then desktop will become priority. Not only for finding cinema tickets but for other things too.
