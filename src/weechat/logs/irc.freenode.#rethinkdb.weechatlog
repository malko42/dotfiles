2017-04-11 20:16:58	FatalNIX	How do changefeeds work internally? if you subsribe to some table or something and somebody updates it, Do you get an event from the rethinkdb server the moment it happens or does the db continuously send a stream of empty updates until there's a population of data? I ask because the client driver I am using is making it seem like the latter, and it just
2017-04-11 20:16:58	FatalNIX	seems a bit weird it wouldn't be a bit more event driven, which I understand is more in the scope of the client driver and not RethinkDB itself..
